At the desk next to me, there's an Irish man, and on the other side a Brazilian man. The whole office went out for drinks together just last week. While we were there, my Irish coworker had so many different anecdotes and really had the whole office doubled over in laughter. The night was a bit ruined by my Brazilian coworker, though. It started out fine, but after their fourth shot, things went really downhill and it was just embarrassing.\n\nWho got really drunk?",
